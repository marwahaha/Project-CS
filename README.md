PLAN DIDN'T WORK OUT, ABANDONED 

# Project-CS
Website aimed to help with python code and provide people with sample questions and answers

===================================================================


This project will be about - collectively creating a website (using all the new and old stuff from Derek's module)

                            -Cool desing , HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python
                            -Possible database to be incorporated 
                            - hopefully push our web design skills to the max :)

                -the website itself is a work in progress with ideas but so far:
                            - python dedicated section where we post sample answers to assignments(already completed)
                            -Weekly python challenge section... where we post a question... then collect an answer and post it
                            -any ideas are welcome :)
